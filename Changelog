Migration Guide - from e!COCKPIT to CODEYS V3.5:
- https://techdocs.wago.com/Software/eCOCKPIT_Migration/en-US/index.html#index_content

System:
[NEW] EC: Touchscreen support for display types:
      Waveshare, Ilitek, PixCir, Elotouch, QDtech
[FIXED] CVE-2022-0529 , CVE-2022-0530
[FIXED] Updates libcurl to version 7.84.0;
      Fixes CVE-2022-22576 , CVE-2022-27782, CVE-2022-30115, CVE-2022-27775,
      CVE-2022-27781, CVE2022-27776, CVE-2022-27779, CVE-2022-27780, CVE-2022-27774,
      CVE-2022-32205, CVE-2022-32206, CVE-2022-32207, CVE-2022-32208

Runtime System:
[NEW] Codesys3 Runtime-System 3.5.18.20
[CHANGED] Codesys3 Runtime-System supported on TP600 Control Panel
      (762-x30x/8000-0002) and Edge Controller (752-8303/8000-0002).
[FIXED] “PLC load watchdog” might not work as expected: the plc load watchdog will
      detect (e.g. an endless loop) but the IEC task might not be stopped in any case.
      This might lead to a complete stop of the runtime process. As workaround and
      improve “hardening” of your IEC application we recommend to use an IEC Task
      watchdog on all your relevant IEC tasks in your IEC application.

[NEW] Change of windowmanager from Fluxbox 1.3.7 to Icewm 2.0.1
[NEW] IR-front sensor can be deactivated via config tool
[NEW] Improved robustness of application control with operating mode switch
      and additional detection of invalid states.
[NEW] IP forwading is activated implicitly when Docker is activated.
[NEW] Libcurl update to version 7.81.0
[NEW] Bootloader update to version 2021.10.0
[FIXED] Sender of SNMP "Informs" could be changed

[FIXED] Network bridges discard their IP address when all associated network
        ports are disconnected.
[FIXED] "Dirty Pipe" enables root privileges CVE-2022-0847
[NEW] Integration of Docker Deamon. Docker now can be installed and ac-tivited
      via. WBM.
[NEW] Users of WBM and Linux where harmonized. User "user" and "admin" can
      still be used for authorization in WBM as default, but they are no
      longer exclusive for WBM. Every WBM user can only change his own
      password now. To use WBM, linux user can be added to group "wbm-admin"
      or "wbm-user". All other users where treated as "guest".
      Note:
      Configuration/change of password in WBM will directly change the
      con-figuration of the corresponding linux user and vice versa. After
      upgrade to FW 20, login in WBM is not possible with the old WBM
      passwords; you must use the passwords of the corresponding linux us-ers.
      After a following downgrade to FW 19 (or less), WBM will use the WBM
      default passwords.
[NEW] "Codesys port authentication password" can no longer be changed via WBM.
[NEW] From FW20 the HTTPS port is always active and cannot be disabled via WBM
      or configtool. Please note that this will be the state after a firmware
      update, regardless which state was configured before. If nec-essary, the
      HTTPS port can be blocked via the firewall.
[NEW] PTXdist update to version 2020.8.0
[NEW] openSSL update to version 1.1.1.L
[NEW] Busybox update to version 1.34.1

 [FIXED] CAN interface goes into BusOff by TxOverflow
-BACnet
 [NEW]The BACnet revision has been updated from revision 14 to revision 22
-Cloud Connectivity
[NEW] Proxy configuration for MS Azure + Wago Cloud in WBM configurable

Runtime System:
[NEW] e!RUNTIME Upgrade to version 3.5.17.3
      (based on CODESYS 3.5, SP 17, Patch 3)
      Fixed CVE-2021-29242, CVE-2021-36765, CVE-2021-33485, CVE-2021-36763,
            CVE-2021-36764, CVE-2022-1989

Functional change:
[DEPRECATED] Config tool function get_telecontrol_state will be removed in
             future releases. The config tool was used to determine whether a
             device is a telecon-trol. Since telecontrol services can be added
             by dynamic licensing, the tool is no longer needed.
[DEPRECATED] DHCP and DNS Server will be removed in future releases. For the
             transition, it will be included for now. In the next release, the
             servers will still be part of the firmware.
[REMOVED] Removed Telnet server, use SSH instead.
[REMOVED] Removed TFTP server.

Beta functionalities:
[BETA] "Wago Device Access" for parametrization and configuration.
       The service is available and can already be tested. Changes in the
       model and behavior are possible for future versions. REST-API is active
       under path "<host>/wda" on port 443. File-Access-API is active under
       path "<host>/files" on port 443. To disable the service, delete symlink
       "/etc/rc.d/S11_paramd" or move it to subdirectory "disabled". Compared
       to the last firmware, many more parameter providers have been added.
