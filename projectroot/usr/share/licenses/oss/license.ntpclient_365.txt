 *  Compile with -DPRECISION_SIOCGSTAMP if your machine really has it.
 *  There are patches floating around to add this to Linux, but
 *  usually you only get an answer to the nearest jiffy.
 *  Hint for Linux hacker wannabes: look at the usage of get_fast_time()
 *  in net/core/dev.c, and its definition in kernel/time.c .

 *  If the compile gives you any flak, check below in the section
 *  labelled "XXX fixme - non-automatic build configuration".
