Directory external/sax
Simple API for XML, a standard application interface for processing XML.
All files are distributed with the following short notice:

  NO WARRANTY!  This class is in the Public Domain.

The www.saxproject.org explains:

  Copyright Status

  SAX is free!

  In fact, it's not possible to own a license to SAX, since it's been
  placed in the public domain.

  No Warranty

  Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no warranty
  for the design or for the software implementation, to the extent
  permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing
  the copyright holders and/or other parties provide SAX "as is" without
  warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
  limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
  a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and
  performance of SAX is with you. Should SAX prove defective, you assume
  the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

  In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
  writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify
  and/or redistribute SAX, be liable to you for damages, including any
  general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of
  the use or inability to use SAX (including but not limited to loss of
  data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or
  third parties or a failure of the SAX to operate with any other
  programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the
  possibility of such damages.

  Copyright Disclaimers

  This page includes statements to that effect by David Megginson, who
  would have been able to claim copyright for the original work.

  SAX 1.0

  Version 1.0 of the Simple API for XML (SAX), created collectively by
  the membership of the XML-DEV mailing list, is hereby released into
  the public domain.

  No one owns SAX: you may use it freely in both commercial and
  non-commercial applications, bundle it with your software
  distribution, include it on a CD-ROM, list the source code in a book,
  mirror the documentation at your own web site, or use it in any other
  way you see fit.

  David Megginson, sax@megginson.com

  SAX 2.0

  I hereby abandon any property rights to SAX 2.0 (the Simple API for
  XML), and release all of the SAX 2.0 source code, compiled code, and
  documentation contained in this distribution into the Public
  Domain. SAX comes with NO WARRANTY or guarantee of fitness for any
  purpose.

<br />
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional<br />
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version<br />
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that<br />
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that<br />
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.<br />
<br />
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of<br />
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled<br />
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of<br />
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the<br />
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.<br />
<br />
0. Definitions.<br />
<br />
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime<br />
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an<br />
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based<br />
on the Runtime Library.<br />
<br />
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without<br />
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of<br />
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any<br />
subsequent versions published by the FSF.<br />
<br />
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,<br />
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with<br />
the license of GCC.<br />
<br />
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual<br />
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for<br />
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution<br />
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any<br />
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used<br />
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.<br />
<br />
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in<br />
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in<br />
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,<br />
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered<br />
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be<br />
understood as starting with the output of the generators or<br />
preprocessors.<br />
<br />
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or<br />
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any<br />
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to<br />
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an<br />
Eligible Compilation Process.<br />
<br />
1. Grant of Additional Permission.<br />
<br />
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by<br />
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such<br />
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that<br />
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You<br />
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,<br />
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.<br />
<br />
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.<br />
<br />
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general<br />
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft<br />
requirements of the license of GCC.<br />
