This is an introduction to modular-\/config-\/tools framework to create modular and unit testable config tools.

\subsection*{Basic configuration for a modular config tool}

To create a modular config tool you can just add a new target for an executable to the makefile of this project. But you are also free to create your own project as well. As an example how to do that you may take a look to the makefile settings for build target {\itshape helloworld.\+elf} in this project. The {\itshape helloworld.\+elf} config tool is the example config tool for this project (see \href{examples.html}{\tt examples page}). Its key makefile settings are explained now.

\subsubsection*{Build settings}

To use the framework core functionality the primary library {\itshape libconfigtoolutils} are linked statically. In addition the library {\itshape libconfigtoolfail} is linked statically which provides a config tool common implementation for {\itshape wc\+\_\+\+Fail}, needed to use the assertion macros from {\itshape common-\/header} project in header file {\itshape wc/assertion.\+h}.

To keep the config tool modular and unit testable, its source modules cannot contain a main function. To use a common, predefined main function implementation the {\itshape helloworld.\+elf} config tool added the common main source module \href{main_8c.html}{\tt {\itshape \char`\"{}src/common/main.\+c\char`\"{}}} to its source list.

\subsubsection*{Entry points for a modular config tool}

By convention the {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+ct\+Main} function from \href{ctmain_8h.html}{\tt {\itshape \char`\"{}ctparts/ctmain.\+h\char`\"{}}} is the entry point for the config tool core functionality. All possible parameter option evaluation and resource acquisition should be already done at this point. Options and resources are shipped in with structures \href{structctutil__Options.html}{\tt {\itshape ctutil\+\_\+\+Options\+\_\+t}} and \href{structctutil__Resources.html}{\tt {\itshape ctutil\+\_\+\+Resources\+\_\+t}}. Both structures are customizable for config tool specific parameter options and resources.

To prepare the {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+ct\+Main} function (e.\+g. evaluate parameter options and acquire resources) the main function in the common main source module \href{main_8c.html}{\tt {\itshape \char`\"{}src/common/main.\+c\char`\"{}}} calls the {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Prepare\+Main} function from \href{pmain_8h.html}{\tt {\itshape \char`\"{}ctparts/pmain.\+h\char`\"{}}}. This is by convention the entry point for the config tool functionality to prepare options and resources. This function has to call the specific config tool main function {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+ct\+Main}.

\subsection*{Common main and predefined prototypes}

As a help to implement the {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Prepare\+Main} function from \href{pmain_8h.html}{\tt {\itshape \char`\"{}ctparts/pmain.\+h\char`\"{}}} you may use the {\itshape ctutil\+\_\+\+Common\+Main} function from \href{common_main_8h.html}{\tt {\itshape \char`\"{}ctutil/common\+\_\+main.\+h\char`\"{}}}.

This function takes a function table and a user specific context to run a predefined preparation sequence. Common resources acquired by calling the function {\itshape ctutil\+\_\+\+Open\+Common\+Resources} and released afterwards by calling the function {\itshape ctutil\+\_\+\+Release\+Common\+Resources}. Also the {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+ct\+Main} function is called in the sequence. The following function pointers may be additionally part of the sequence and the function table (optional functions may be N\+U\+LL in given function table)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Print\+Info\+Text\+\_\+ptr} -\/ Prints program information text (optional)
\item {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Set\+Option\+Defaults\+\_\+ptr} -\/ Sets config tool option defaults (mandatory, optionally may also allocate a specific options struct)
\item {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Release\+Specific\+Options\+\_\+ptr} -\/ Releases config tool specific options (optional, mandatory if specific options struct allocated)
\item {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Evaluate\+Early\+Options\+\_\+ptr} -\/ Evaluates options that have to be honored before other options (optional)
\item {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Evaluate\+Options\+\_\+ptr} -\/ Evaluates config tool options (optional)
\item {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Open\+Specific\+Resources\+\_\+ptr} -\/ Opens config tool specific resources (optional)
\item {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Release\+Specific\+Resources\+\_\+ptr} -\/ Releases config tool specific resources (optional, mandatory if {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+\+Open\+Specific\+Resources\+\_\+ptr} used)
\end{DoxyItemize}

To implement preparation functions you may use the prototypes defined in \href{common_main_8h.html}{\tt {\itshape \char`\"{}ctutil/common\+\_\+main.\+h\char`\"{}}}. To set the function table {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+common\+Main\+Functions\+\_\+t} to the predefined defaults the helper function {\itshape ctutil\+\_\+\+Set\+Default\+Common\+Main\+Functions} is available.

\subsection*{Unit tests for a modular config tool}

tbd

Core functionality is tested by calling {\itshape ctparts\+\_\+ct\+Main} function.

Preparations may be tested by calling separated functions if necessary.
