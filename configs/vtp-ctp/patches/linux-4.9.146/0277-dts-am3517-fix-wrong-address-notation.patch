Subject: [PATCH] dts: am3517: fix wrong address notation

The address notation within the nodepath string is not following
the convention as it is generally used. This naming is important
for e.g. for fixups done by the bootloader, in our case by the barebox
boot code. Here e.g. the mac address is read from the eeprom and added
to the oftree. In this case the nodepath is matched against the oftree
that resides within the bootloader.
