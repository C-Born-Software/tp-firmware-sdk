Subject: [PATCH] dts: pfc200v3: cpsw: disable second rmii port to fix net
 traffic stagnation

After receiving an unspecific amount of packets the network interface
will stop to work on the receive channel.

The folling 'nping' command would freeze the interface:

sudo nping --icmp -N -H -c 50000000 --rate 10000 -e eth0 <ip_addr>

This is a workaround and does not remove the real problem.
The second interface has somehow influence on the behaviour of the
primary port.
