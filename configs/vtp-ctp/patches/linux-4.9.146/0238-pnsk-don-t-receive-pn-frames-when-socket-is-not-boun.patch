Subject: [PATCH] pnsk: don't receive pn frames when socket is not bound to a
 device

This fixes a race during initialization of the pn socket. When we
receive frames during initialization an access violation can happen,
which then prevents any further communication via ethernet.
Also its possilby that the receive queue (ring) gets stalled forever.
