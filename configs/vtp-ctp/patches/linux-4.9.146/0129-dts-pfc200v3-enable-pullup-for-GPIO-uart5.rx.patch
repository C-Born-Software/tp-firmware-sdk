Subject: [PATCH] dts: pfc200v3: enable pullup for GPIO uart5.rx

In PFC200v3 UART5 RX will driven by KBus CPU, but not till first communication.
Till first communication UART5 RX could be low (after reset state of GPIO is
INPUT with PULLDOWN).
At first time communication KBus CPU drive RX (his TX) pin to high and start
communication nearly immediately (after about 5us). Sometimes first received character
on mail CPU (AM335X) will be interpret wrong, because start bit was miss. To avoid this
pullup will enable while initialisation for UART5 pin muxing.
